            Aunt Viv: Lou, if you walk out of Will's life now, don't you ever come back!

            <br>Uncle Phil: You know, Will was doing just fine 'til you showed up. But now that you're back, you have responsibilities to him!
            <br>Lou: Look, we're still gonna take the trip.
            <br>Uncle Phil: Oh, bull! Bull! Will is not a coat that you hang in the coat and pick up whenever you're ready to wear it! His life goes on. He's not supposed to be here for you. You're supposed to be here for him!
            <br>Lou: Get off my back! You think I want this? It just happened! Now, Will was a baby and I was scared-

            Uncle Phil: Cut the crap, alright? Cut it! Cause I've been there but I didn't run out on my family. I was there everyday for them because that's what a man does.
            <br>Lou: Fine, Phillip! You win! You're the man. You're a man better than me. You happy? Now you gonna tell Will or not?
            <br>Uncle Phil: I'm not gonna do your dirty work for you.
            <br>Lou: Fine. I'll call him from the road.
            <br>Uncle Phil: Then why don't you do that? 
            <br>Lou: Yeah, I'll do that.

            <br>Lou: Will! Hey, I'm glad you're here. Um, some business came up I gotta handle so we're gonna have to put, uh, our trip on hold. You understand. 
            <br>Will: Yeah. Yeah, that's cool. That's cool.
            <br>Lou: Just for a couple of weeks..
            <br>Will: Mhm. I understand.
            <br>Lou: Maybe longer.
            <br>Will: Yeah. Whatever. Whatever.
            <br>Lou: Look, I'll call you next week and we'll iron out the details okay?
            <br>Will: Yeah..

            <br>Uncle Phil: Will, it's alright to be angry.
            <br>Will: Hey, why should I be mad? At least he said goodbye this time. I just wish I hadn't wasted my money buying his stupid present.

Ain't like I'm gonna be sitting up every night, asking my mom when's daddy coming home, you know. Who needs him? He wasn't there to teach me how to shoot my first basket but I learned, didn't I? Hey, I got pretty damn good at it too, Uncle Phil.
            <br>Uncle Phil: Yeah, you did.
            <br>Will: Got through my first day without him. Right? I learned how to drive. I learned how to shave, how to fight without him. I had 14 great birthdays without him! He never even sent me a damn card. TO HELL WITH HIM!

            <br>Will: You know what, Uncle Phil? Imma get through college without him. I'm gonna get a great job without him. Imma marry me a beautiful honey and I'm having a whole bunch of kids and I'll be a better father than he ever was and I sure as hell don't need him for that cause ain't a damn thing he could ever teach me about how to love my kids!
